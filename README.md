# RadioControl
Windows Universal App that allows command-line control of radio devices

Launch the app to be running (even minimized), and then you can use it from commandline like:

    radiocontrol.exe 0 on
    radiocontrol Bluetooth off
    
If you get problems like `command not found` and alike, please report them as an issue here. As a workaround, call the program by the absolute path:

    "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\radiocontrol.EXE"

## (Better) alternative

You can even control your radios without installing any app, just using a cmdlet described here: https://superuser.com/a/1293303/255660 .

## Supported platforms

Windows 10 Anniversary Update and newer (fall 2016+).

## Building

To build the app, you need to open the solution in Visual Studio 2017.
